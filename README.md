# CTK Email Signature Generator

Internal HTML-based email signature generator used by CodetheKiwi.

This repository contains a small utility for generating consistent, branded
email signatures for team members. It is intentionally simple and tailored
to CodetheKiwi’s branding and layout requirements.

## Overview
- Plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- Live preview while editing fields
- Designed for compatibility with common email clients
- Hardcoded structure and styles (not a generic generator)

## Usage
1. Open `index.html` in a browser
2. Fill in the required fields
3. Copy the generated signature from the preview into your email client

## Notes
Although this tool is published publicly, it is primarily intended for
internal use. Others are free to copy or adapt the code if it fits their needs.
